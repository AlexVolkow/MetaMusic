README for the trm Utility
-----------------------------

Note: 0.1.0 does not properly work on Windows yet.

You'll need the MusicBrainz client library and MAD MP3 decode library or
Ogg/Vorbis installed installed to compile this program.

   MusicBrainz client library (2.0.0-pre1 or later):

       ftp://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz

   MAD MP3 Decoder:

       http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg

   Ogg/Vorbis

       http://vorbis.com

The usage is simple:

   trm [-m|-o|-w] <mp3 | ogg/vorbis | wav file>

The trm program will decode the first 30 seconds of audio file and
then spit out a TRM id (see http://www.relatable.com for details) on
stdout. If some error occurs, the error message is printed to stderr.

trmtest.pl TRM test script
--------------------------

If you'd like to test the TRM server, use the test/trmtest.pl script. 
To run this script, you need the following programs installed:

 - perl
 - cdparanoia
 - lame
 - oggenc (ogg/vorbis/vorbistools)
 - trm (this package compiled/installed)

To run:

1. Insert a CD into your primary CD-ROM drive
2. run test/trmtest.pl <output csv file>

The script will call cdparanoia to rip the first 30 seconds of each track,
encode to mp3 with lame, to ogg/vorbis with oggenc and then use the
trm utility to get the TRM for each of the three versions. Once the
entire CD has been processed, it writes a CVS (comma seperated values)
file as the output file.
